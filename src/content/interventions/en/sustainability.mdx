Making has the potential to contribute to green recovery efforts, by experimenting and scaling with circular product designs. Tolocar supports those innovations to reduce waste, recycle and conserve resources.

The environmental damage caused by the war is huge and well documented. Nature reserves and maritime ecosystems have been destroyed and polluted and waste volume has increased exponentially. Green innovation is an essential element for Ukraine's just and sustainable future. To contribute to Ukraine's green recovery, Tolocar combines innovation, empowerment and meaningful partnerships. 

## Circular Product Designs
Tolocar supports makers and innovators to experiment with circular product designs, like products made from recycled materials (e.g. the potential for reusing plastic bottles or debris from destroyed buildings). Already existing sustainable open-source inventions are developed and adapted to apply them locally. One of the winning teams of Tolocar's Makers Innovation Award, NGO Kultgroup, are working on establishing a sustainable recycling technology lab within Lviv Polytechnic, providing an interdisciplinary hands-on learning environment for students. This involves the development of an innovative technology for manufacturing road surfaces using plastic waste. Tolocar also supported an eco-settlement in Kyiv oblast to build a solar-powered watering system.

## Partnerships for Sustainability
Tolocar partners with local NGOs to support them in accomplishing their green vision and build their capacities. For instance, the NGO Eco Misto aims to transform Chernihiv in a bike-friedly city. Together with Tolocar they were able to develop their making capabilities to realize several local projects: Over the course of four days in April 2023, Tolocar, XYZ Cargo, the NGO Eko Misto, and local volunteers, assembled three open-source electric cargo tricycles. The XYZ Cargo bikes boast a locally-reproducible design, reinforcing Eko Misto's advocacy for cycling-focused living. From personal health to community empowerment repairability, these bikes embody the essence of sustainable urban mobility. One of the cargo bikes now serves as a mobile bike repair workshop, while the other two cater to specific priorities set by the local community: repairing homes and delivering food to vulnerable members of the community.

## Engaging Society
Tolocar involves civil society and local volunteers in their green activities to strengthen environmental awareness. For instance, Tolocar held workshops on building a machine producing filament for 3D printers from PET plastic bottles for children and students in Lebedyn, Okhtyrka and Trostyanets.
