Tolocar supports makers to establish and equip makerspaces in their cities where they can meet, experiment, innovate and build according to their needs. In total, we supported in establishing or renovating 11 makerspaces and equipping 12 further makerspaces, for instance by hosting machine replication workshops for 3D printers. 

Makerspaces are crucial to grow a community of innovators contributing to Ukraine's recovery and responding to specific local recovery needs. They not only provide a space for children, students, makers and entrepreneurs to innovate and experiment, but also for face-to-face encounter, co-creation and skill-development. Universities and libraries can substitute as such spaces, but they are often not equipped specifically for that purpose. Tolocar supports makers in establishing and equipping makerspaces in universities, schools, libraries, abandoned buildings, or other locations.
For these projects, the initiative lies with local makers, to ensure the long-term use. Oftentimes, local volunteers, activists, local authorities, businesses, and NGOs participate in the renovation as well, e.g. by building furniture. If possible, the Tolocar team uses materials which are already available and recycles them to put into new use. Additionally, Tolocar operators offer consultations to makerspace owners on how to run a makerspace efficiently and profitably and conduct technical trainings for handling the machines. Furthermore, Tolocar works actively to connect new makerspaces and makers with the national and international making communities to enhance knowledge exchange and collaboration.
The goal is to provide an equipped space and develop relevant capacities to operate and maintain it. 

## Chernihiv: Peremoha Lab
An old university cinema in bad condition in Chernihiv was renovated and transformed into a place for creativity and innovation. For the renovations, the entire Tolocar fleet, students, teachers and over 100 volunteers worked hand in hand. 

> "Peremoha Lab is a freely available space we renovated into a makerspace – a space filled with various machinery, where we are able to work with different technologies to create prototypes and most importantly create a community of Chernihiv makers. Here, we want to bring people together, and support them with both equipment and expertise."
> 
> – Serhiy Bezborodko, head of Peremoha lab

The furniture was made by the members of the community, using open-source designs and digital production technologies, like CNC milling. In that way, a culture of open-source design is promoted within the community, as it enables the exchange, development, and scaling of ideas. By involving the community in the renovations and furnishing, self-efficacy and sense of belonging and ownership is strengthened. The construction itself becomes a capacity building measure, ensuring sustainable impact. The renovated space is equipped with open-source machines, digital production technologies, furniture and tools. The makerspace “Peremoha Lab” offers the community free access to modern equipment and technologies to bring ideas to life.

> "Having the opportunity to turn conversations into tangible things is paving the way to the kind of community we want to build. This lab will provide them with the incentive to grow and gain momentum."
> 
> – Konstantyn Leonenko, Tolocar Operations

The public launch of the Peremoha Lab was July 2023 and after that, the space quickly became the flagship project for the redevelopment of Chernihiv attracting major funding from various sources.

## Truskavets: School #3
In Truskavets, Tolocar supported in establishing a new makerspace in School #3, enabling the children of the school to immerse into the maker spirit. Truskavets in Lviv Oblast is a renowned spa and rehabilitation town in the Carpathian mountains, which has become a place of healing and support for veterans seeking treatment for their physical and psychological traumas. The Tolocar Project conducted a transformative workshop here that brought together veterans and children. The children, equipped with basic 3D design skills, were guided to embrace a user-centric design approach, understanding the needs and challenges faced by the veterans. They developed a personalized phone holder to assist veterans using crutches. But even more,  the interaction between the children and veterans proved to be a powerful therapeutic tool, facilitating healing through empathy and understanding. The resounding success of the workshop resonated with the teachers of the school. The Tolocar project supported them to build an own makerspace within the school, providing equipment, building digital manufacturing machines, running workshops and giving hands on tips for running a makerspace for the new generation of compassionate innovators.
