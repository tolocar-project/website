Makerspaces are places of creativity, connectedness, and self-expression. This makes them the perfect place to bring together communities and enabling them to live and celebrate local culture. By combining cultural heritage with modern manufacturing technologies, “making” can have an uplifting and enriching impact on art, history, and music. Tolocar aims to help preserving and promoting traditional crafts and cultural practices that might be at risk during times of conflict. Modern technologies are used to digitize models of cultural objects like instruments, ornaments, museum objects and historic buildings. The scans of those objects can then be replicated using 3D printing technology. This makes cultural objects more accessible and encourages the engagement with them. 

## Wooden Lace
In Sokolivka and Chernihiv, traditional wooden decorations on buildings are restored using digital manufacturing tools. 

> "We were provided with samples for the wooden lace, and we used them for our renderings. Then, we transferred those to our portable CNC router."
> 
> – Oleksandr, Tolocar operator

Those “wooden lace” elements entail intricate geometric and floral designs. The local NGO Wooden Lace of Chernihiv and numerous volunteers supported in manufacturing the designs, using a portable laser cutter to accelerate the process while ensuring precision. The designs are also digitized and published.

> "This house was built by my great-grandfather over 100 years ago. We preserved this house because we love it so much, but we could not do the carvings, so we are grateful for this project helping us restore this antiquity."
> 
> – Zoya, homeowner of restored building

> "Tolocar helped us carve replacement pieces of the lace from our sketches. They also initiated a side-project creating souvenir samples of the lace to help us raise money by selling them as key chains."
> 
> – Stanislav Ivashenko, founder of Wooden Lace Chernihiv

## Musical Instruments
In Chernihiv, Tolocar supported the fabrication of traditional musical instruments by using 3D printing technology. Chernihiv was home to the late master instrument maker Oleksandr Shlionchyk, who is known all over Ukraine for crafting wooden flutes and percussion instruments. A Tolocar project sought to honor this musical heritage by 3D printing plastic replicas of a wooden ratchet and the beloved ocarina, a traditional Ukrainian flute. This endeavor was not just a replication of instruments, but a profound effort to revitalize Ukraine's rich musical tradition, bringing music and magic to those who are enduring the hardships of war. Nata Zhyzhchenko, Oleksandr Shlionchyk's granddaughter and lead singer of the popular Ukrainian band Onuka, invited Tolocar into her grandfather's preserved workshop to employ 3D scanning to to create the replicas, ensuring authenticity in every note. In the end, Nata even preferred the plastic ratchet over a wooden one. However, preserving the authentic sounds of the ocarina required the deft touch of Oleksandr Beshen, the last student of Shlyonchyk. In a resounding celebration of Ukrainian heritage, Onuka played an improvised concert. As the 3D printed ocarina and triskachka took center stage, the beauty of this project shone through, giving voice to a nation's history and resilience, and spreading the healing power of music.

> "This showcases that our present-day Ukraine is creative and cool and deeply-rooted in culture. I'm proud of Chernihiv having this connected community determined to create a better future."
> 
> – Nata Zhyzhchenko, frontwoman of band ONUKA

## 3D Scanning of Historical Artifacts
In Okhtyrka, Tolocar hosted a workshop on 3D scanning, modelling, and printing at a museum. The museum staff, students, and teachers of educational institutions in the community were learned about the possibilities of preserving historical heritage using digital technologies.
