Inviting spaces to come together and have face-to-face interactions are crucial for mental health and community. Tolocar supports in creating such spaces, engaging the future users in the design of the spaces to address their specific requirements and foster ownership. The principles of accessibility, and safety play a crucial role in the co-creative process. 

## Multifunctional Shelters
During frequent air raid alerts in Ukraine, basic basement rooms are often used as shelters. However, many times those spaces are in bad condition and not equipped to hold people for an extended period of time, especially families or persons with disabilities. With the support of Tolocar three basements belonging to universities and residential buildings in Kyiv were renovated and converted into multifunctional rooms, which can be used even after the war.

> "A safe space like this enables openness, encounters, creating community - all of this contributes to relief during war."

> – KNUBA Student


The unique aspect about this renovation is the deep involvement of local communities throughout the entire process – from the concept phase in which their needs and ideas for the spaces are heard; over the construction phase in which they build modular furniture together with the Tolocar team; until the maintenance of the space, as the furniture and structures are designed in a way that they can be repaired with basic skills and tools.

> "For us, it is important to build shelters that will not deteriorate in a few months. To make these shelters sustainable we fill them with functions that are important to the residents."
> 
> – Roman, project lead

As the community decides how the basements should be used, each space has taken on a distinct character and purpose: one includes a stage for music performances, one a сo-working area, one contains a lecture hall for students. Today, the spaces are used for cultural events, concerts, studying and working.

> "We want grassroots initiatives like this to flourish within the university. Students noticed that it was uncomfortable to stay in the shelter during alarms, with nowhere to sit, and the space was unattractive and inconvenient. This project aims to activate the space: the shelter becomes a place where people can gather, unite, and make it more comfortable for themselves. Since students were involved in creating this space, they will treat it as their own."

## Summer Camp in Truskavets
Tolocar worked with the participants of a summer camp in Truskavets. Together with all camp participants the operators designed and made outdoor furniture for the schoolyard. They collected the students’ ideas and selected two projects, of which we created prototypes using 3D modeling software (Blender, SktechUp, Tinkercad). Within two days we built 5 seats made of plywood that can be used on stairs and two deck chairs made of aerated concrete. During the construction, the students actively helped the operators and learned how to use various hand and power tools, including Shaper Origin - a hand-held CNC router.
