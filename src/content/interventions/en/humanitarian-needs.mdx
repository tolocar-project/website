Tolocar hosts workshops teaching how to craft various products which directly address humanitarian needs, like heating mats, emergency replacement windows and battery-powered flashlights. Through those workshops, Tolocar not only provides the products themselves to the communities but teaches them how to manufacture further items after the workshops from cheap and available materials. In this way, the participants can self-help and even customize products according to their own needs. Workshop participants can act as multipliers of knowledge, by passing on the knowledge to more people. Those “doing-it-together” activities can additionally strengthen the self-confidence and sense of community.

## Emergency Windows
Insulating emergency windows made from PVC pipes, duct tape and polyethylene. The multiple layers of polyethylene create air chambers preventing heat loss. The blueprint is available as open-source, the materials cost around 10€ per square meter, and it can be built and installed at home in 15 minutes without the risk of shattering again. The Tolocar team replaced 40 windows in total in the Sumy region and held 3 workshops for municipal workers to teach them how to build further windows subsequently.

## Emergency Flashlights
In several workshops, participants learned how to solder and build battery-powered emergency lights. For instance, in Irpin women of a women’s shelter participated in the activity. In Kyiv, volunteers crafted 28 lights to donate to 3 animal shelters and developed the skills to produce more on their own.

## House Renovations
Together, our team contributed to the renovation of a home belonging to a solitary elderly woman, whose residence had been ravaged by a Russian artillery shell. This was a continuation of earlier work carried out by various volunteer groups. We then concentrated in particular on renovating the walls and ceilings of the house. This was the second time that Tolocar had worked in areas heavily affected by military occupation and it was a very insightful experience for the team to understand the needs of such communities. It became very clear how necessary access to ‘low-tech’ tools and materials is in such areas and how effective renovation work is for both the recipients of this aid and those who provide it.The team was deeply convinced of the impact of ‘making’ and that soft skills and empathy are as important as the ability to operate a hammer drill.

## Heating Mats
In Kyiv, workshop participants learned how to craft heating mats using minimal electricity from materials under 10€. The mats can be very useful during the cold winter. They also learned a new skill in the process: soldering.
