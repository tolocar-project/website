title: Promoting Inclusivity and Mental Health
teaser: Tolocar hosts workshops teaching how to craft various products which directly address humanitarian needs, like heating mats, emergency replacement windows and battery-powered flashlights. Through those workshops, Tolocar not only provides the products themselves to the communities but teaches them how to manufacture further items after the workshops from cheap and available materials.

The act of making can have a positive impact on mental wellbeing. There are first studies that prove the positive effects of making, as it contributes to various pillars of wellbeing: Companionship and collaboration, sense of agency and autonomy, creativity and self-expression and the calming being-in-the-moment effect of concentrated flow-state making. 

During the Tolocar activities, a positive psychological impact on individuals who may be experiencing stress and trauma due to war can be seen, as it helps to refocus on and engage in constructive activities, increasing self-efficacy and hope. Tolocar's activities actively involve vulnerable groups like IDPs, veterans and children. While the superficial goal of those activities is to craft specific products, making can spark conversations about topics which are usually harder to talk about. 

> "When we came to Okhtyrka, the most important thing for the people we worked with were not the windows we fixed, but that there was somebody there to listen to them, to hear their stories, and know that we care, even if we were complete strangers. And that was what they needed, and that is what I mean when I say that we don't help Ukraine in an abstract way, but help real Ukrainians."

## Workshops with veterans
Truskavets is a renowned rehabilitation town in the Carpathian mountains, which has become a place of healing and support for veterans seeking treatment for their physical and psychological traumas. The Tolocar Project conducted a transformative workshop here in November 2022 that brought together veterans and school children. The children, equipped with basic 3D design skills learned as part of their curriculum, were guided to embrace a user-centric design approach, understanding the needs and challenges faced by the veterans. While the tangible outcome of the workshop was a personalized phone holder to assist veterans using crutches, the interaction between the children and veterans proved to be a powerful therapeutic tool, facilitating healing through empathy and understanding. The resounding success of the initial workshop and the potential of the Fab Lab concept resonated with the teachers of School No.3. On February 22, 2023, the Fab Lab at School No. 3 was officially inaugurated, a testament to the collaborative effort between Tolocar, the local authorities, and the business community in Truskavets. We are really proud to be a part of the efforts that will continue to transform lives and uplift communities, embracing a future where no one is left behind. Other inclusive workshops with veterans are held for instance in Ivano-Frankivsk.
