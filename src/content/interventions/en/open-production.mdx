subtitle: Promoting Open-source Knowledge Sharing and Distributed Manufacturing
teaser: Tolocar supports local manufacturing, contributing to resilience and mitigating local supply bottlenecks. Distributed, local manufacturing can address supply bottlenecks and empower local entrepreneurship. It also reduces transportation costs, lead times and dependencies contributing to a more resilient supply chain and local preferences can be considered more easily.

Tolocar supports local manufacturing, contributing to resilience and mitigating local supply bottlenecks. Distributed, local manufacturing can address supply bottlenecks and empower local entrepreneurship. It also reduces transportation costs, lead times and dependencies contributing to a more resilient supply chain and local preferences can be considered more easily.

The war has negative impact on the supply chain of goods in Ukraine. Border closures, transportation obstacles, and infrastructure destruction complicate logistics processes. This leads to a decrease in the availability of goods, an increase in their cost and causes challenges for local businesses. Makerspaces can act as regional collaborative innovation hubs enabling local and highly customized production in small batches. Tolocar supports the establishment and the development of makerspaces by consulting them in the planning process and by supporting them in building the actual physical space and equipment. To democratize manufacturing even more, Tolocar leads workshops in which makers can learn how to build machines like 3D printers, plotters and laser cutters themselves. Apart from supporting makerspaces as local manufacturing hubs, Tolocar advertises open-source knowledge sharing of product designs, e.g. on platforms like GitHub and Appropedia. In that way, local manufacturing can benefit from designs and innovations of the global maker community.

## Machine Replication
Tolocar hosted several machine replication workshops, teaching how to build machines like 3D printers and laser cutters. For a new makerspace in the Konotop Institute of Sumy State University, Tolocar assembled a Fabulaser Mini was built together with students and teachers, with remote support from Lianna (InMachines). The laser will be used for making products and for educational purposes.

## Global Knowledge Sharing
Global Innovation Gathering (GIG) supported seven projects of Ukrainian and international makers who collaboratively developed a product and shared its blueprint on the open-source platform Appropedia. For instance, they shared the design of a solar-powered water filtration system, a brick for construction which is made from debris of destroyed buildings (“re-birth brick”), and an educational starter kit for teaching children about IoT. All project outcomes are presented [on Appropedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Tolocar) and YouTube:
