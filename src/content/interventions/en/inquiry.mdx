title: Learning through Inquiry
subtitle: Elevating Education by Embracing the "Maker" Spirit
teaser: 'Making can contribute to education in unique ways: It promotes a multi-disciplinary approach, it provides knowledge by tackling real-world problems and it offers flexible learning arrangements, like peer learning and mentoring. Students can not only develop competences in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Maths), crafting, design, IT and architecture, but also sharpen soft skills like collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking  and innovating.'

Making can contribute to education in unique ways: It promotes a multi-disciplinary approach, it provides knowledge by tackling real-world problems and it offers flexible learning arrangements, like peer learning and mentoring. Students can not only develop competences in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Maths), crafting, design, IT and architecture, but also sharpen soft skills like collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking  and innovating. 

The ongoing war has taken a toll on Ukraine's education system, as educational institutions are destroyed, lessons are disrupted by alarms and students' mental health is affected. For Ukraine's recovery it is crucial that learning gaps are overcome and that skilled workforce in key sectors like IT, urban development, transport and logistics are trained. Tolocar supports making and makerspaces within various educational institutions. Tolocar not only provides access to tools and technology, but also supports educational institutions by intoducing making culture, conducting making workshops, and even helping to establish own makerspaces within the institutions. To do that, Tolocar collaborates with schools, youth centers and other educational institutions. The virtual Maker Academy extends its impact beyond in-person workshops which require physical access to a (mobile) makerspace.

## Makerspace BootCamp
In 2023 together with Ostriv, Tolocar conducted a Makerspace BootCamp - a dynamic educational workshop aimed at creating and supporting makerspaces in schools and developing a visionary approach to education. BootCamp consisted of two stages: A week of online lectures from speakers within the Tolocar partner network was followed by a week-long practical workshop, during which teams brainstormed and developed their vision for future makerspaces, creating 3D architectural models. Throughout this construction process, the six selected teams participated in an iterative learning cycle. The bootcamp has provided participants with practical skills in CAD modeling, laser cutting, and 3D printing, fostering creativity and innovation.  In the second stage, the best ideas will be brought to life as makerspaces in schools, facilitating hands-on learning wherever possible.

## Engineering Week
In the beginning of 2024, students from more than 1.000 participating schools in Ukraine are immersed in hands-on activities aimed at unleashing their creativity and passion for innovation. Engineering Week is organized by the Ukrainian Makers Association and supported by the Tolocar project. Under the guidance of dedicated teachers, students are rolling up their sleeves to test ideas and build solutions using simple materials. With a focus on self-sufficiency, students explore cutting-edge concepts like recycling of building materials, alternative water purification methods, and even creating mechanical toys and portable lighting devices. Both children and teachers leave their positive feedbacks: the students of all ages are not only gaining valuable engineering skills but also developing confidence in their own abilities. And with adaptations for students with special educational needs, Engineering Week ensures that everyone can participate and thrive.

## Education in Frontline Communities
The Tolocar team partnered with UNICEF and an educational center for children from front-line communities for an online train-the-teacher approach: They held several workshops for teachers in the field of 3D modeling, 3D printing, and robotics. The teachers will continue to transfer the knowledge to the children in their cities
