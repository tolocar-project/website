## Static website hosting
Our website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages provides a content delivery network, or CDN. They store a copy of this website on many servers around the world, so no matter where you are, the website is delivered quickly.

GitHub Pages has access to your HTTP request, the website request required to view this website or any other website. This request includes your IP address and a user agent, a string with the name of your browser and the version you are using.

## Contact via email
Data submitted when contacting us, including contact information, is stored in order to process the request or to be available for follow-up questions.

## Fonts
We integrate fonts on our website via Adobe Fonts. Adobe Fonts allows us to use new fonts without expensive licenses through our Creative Cloud subscription. When you visit the site, your browser loads these fonts from Adobe's servers. In doing so, Adobe learns that your IP address has been used to access our website.

You can find more information about Adobe Fonts via [fonts.adobe.com](https://fonts.adobe.com).
