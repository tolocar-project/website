We care about privacy (we really do!). To better protect it, we provide this policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## What data do we collect?

### Webserver Log Files

When visiting this website, the webserver of our webhoster ([Netcup](https://www.netcup.de/)) tracks basic information about its visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to IP address, browser details, operating system details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors of this website. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes (log files) and will automatically be deleted after one days.

### Website statistics

Aditionally this website also uses the self-hosted frontend statistics software [Umami](https://umami.is/), which we use to analyse and improve our website. Umami does not allow to identify individual users or IP addresses and works without cookies. It collects anonymized data from the visitors (language, timestamps, screen size, operating system, referrers) and saves it to a database, where we keep it indefinitely.

## Cookies

This website does not use any cookies.


## Advertisement and other third parties

There is no advertising on this website. Only one subpage (`/interventions`) uses third party data (the Map data/tiles for the interactive Map) by the company Mapbox.

## What are your data protection rights?

We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every visitor is entitled to the following:

- The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data.
- The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate.
- The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data.
- The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
- The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
- The right to data portability – You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
