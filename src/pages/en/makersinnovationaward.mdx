    **The Innovation Ecosystem of Ukraine** is greatly affected by the war, which has a massive negative effect on the Ukrainian society and its social cohesion. The determined maker movement, a vital part of Ukrainian society, strives to help the nation heal and grow.

    The **Makers Innovation Award (MIA)** aims at fostering collaboration among makers (tech enthusiasts, engineers, designers, crafters) who join forces for social impact and innovation. Eight project ideas showcasing the greatest potential to achieve these aims secured 50,000 Euro of prize money each and will benefit from personalized mentoring sessions to enhance their capacities and refine their project concepts further.
