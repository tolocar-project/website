Chernihiv Wooden Lace (NGO) is an initiative to preserve and replicate unique wooden architecture and its carved decor of Chernihiv region. Tolocar worked with the local team on a restoration project of a house on Muzeina 2B Street on April, 2-14.

The team of the [@demer.cn.ua](https://www.instagram.com/demer.cn.ua/) restored the facade with its ornamental carvings. Tolocar helped with the works using a CNC milling machine and also scanned the precious decor elements, that are especially characterizing the local architecture.
The house itself is not a listed heritage building yet. Anyway, Tolocar is honored to work on a project to protect and replicate the Chernihiv cultural heritage and digitally archive it. And that way, to bring the local craftsmen’ masterpiece to the wider community.

Our impact: 
- 30+ lace volunteers
- 3 owners of wooden houses
- tourists and hundreds of passers-by on the street every day
