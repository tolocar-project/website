TOLOCAR joined the celebration of the 160th anniversary of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in the Okhtyrka History Museum.

Due to the shelling, the museum has no electricity supply. We managed to power the machinery for the 3D printing workshop and provide light for the first aid training conducted by the Red Cross organization with Tolocar's equipment.

We also arranged a temporary open-air cinema in the museum's backyard and aired a documentary about Red Cross history.

A light installation and festive illumination appeared on the walls of the museum in the evening. For the installation, we also used light panels and power from a mobile makerspace.

We thank our partners (RED CROSS SOCIETY in Okhtyrka) and visitors for their involvement and interest in open knowledge, despite all the difficulties.
