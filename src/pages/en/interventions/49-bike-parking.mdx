teaser: How to build a bike rack from scratch? 
---
The TOLOCAR team was invited by the Zeleni Kruchi eco-settlement in the Kyiv region to support the community in terms of making the village more cyclist-friendly. To improve the bicycle adoption in the broader village community, four bike parking racks were fabricated and installed at the local hot-spots of the area. Watch the full video and take a look at how the handcrafted racks are built and installed and what type of rack is best suited.
