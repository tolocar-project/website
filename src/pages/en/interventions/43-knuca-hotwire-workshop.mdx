teaser: Developing better open-source tools for both Ukrainian and global maker communities!
---

The Tolocar team conducted a Research & Development evaluation workshop to assess the user experience of utilising tools such as a pen plotter and hot wire.

💡 A pen plotter is a robotic device capable of drawing images created on a computer using a pen, with the ability to produce drawings on various surfaces, from notebooks to T-shirt fabric.

💡 A hot wire for cutting foam is an indispensable tool for construction and various repair works. However, it was discovered that, beyond its primary functions, it serves as an excellent device for fostering students‘ creativity and providing relaxation during the educational process.

This workshop facilitated improvements in numerous aspects of the design, enabling us to develop better open-source tools for both Ukrainian and global maker communities.
