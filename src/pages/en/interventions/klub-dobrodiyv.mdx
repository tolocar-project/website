Klub Dobrodiiv invited TOLOCAR to run two electronic workshops in November. Together we engaged 25 children into electronics and robotics 🤖.

The 7-9-year-olds studied how electricity works. Young participants of the workshop made glowing postcards and assembled their first circuits with batteries and LEDs.

Kids of age 10-14 dove into robotics. At the workshop, they assembled robots from pre-laser-cut wooden details, engines, and batteries. With the guidance of the Tolocar’s operators, every participant had made a working robot.

Tolocar is open to collaborating with the young and enthusiastic audiences. And to share the basic skills of production in the game. Small steps can do a big journey. We thank the hosting organization for this workshop: Library 115.
