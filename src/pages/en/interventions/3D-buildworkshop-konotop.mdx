TOLOCAR had some impactful days at the robotics school in Konotop, Sumy region.

What we have done in Konotop:
- Assembled two Ender 3 S1 3D printers for the classes of the Classic Colledge of Sumy State University and the robotics school.

- Held a workshop on adjusting, and calibrating 3d printers for students and college teachers. For the students, we made a class on ThinkerCAD modelling basics and Ultimaker Cura pre-printing. The students successfully modeled their first fabrications and printed them.

- We held classes for teachers on curriculum development. We reviewed programs on the basics of working and organizing classes in TinkerCAD, working in Fusion 360, and the basics of 3D printing.

At the end, we had a discussion with the college teachers and talked a lot about their plans. We hope, these days in Konotop were the beginning of a long digital fabrication collaboration.

We thank the hosting organizations: Robogenius Kon, Classical professional college of Sumy State University
