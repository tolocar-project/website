teaser: Designing and making outdoor furniture. 
---
TOLOCAR recently worked with the participants of a summer camp in Truskavets. Together with all camp participants we designed and made outdoor furniture for the schoolyard. We collected the students' ideas and selected two projects, of which we created prototypes using 3D modeling software (Blender, SktechUp, Tinkercad).

Within two days we built 5 seats made of plywood that can be used on stairs and two deck chairs made of aerated concrete. During the construction, the students actively helped our TOLOCAR operators and learned how to use various hand and power tools, including Shaper Origin - a hand-held CNC router. Scroll through the photos to see the process and the result.
