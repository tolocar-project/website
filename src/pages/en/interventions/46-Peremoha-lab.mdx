teaser: Setting up the Peremoha Center for Startups and Innovation in Chernihiv. 
---
The mission to create effective changes, a rational approach and open knowledge were the drivers behind the construction of the Peremoha Center for Startups and Innovation at the National University ‘Chernihiv Polytechnic’.

TOLOCAR and architect Roman Sakh were part of the renovation of an old movie theater into a modern startup center @peremoha.center. The main challenge of the project were short deadlines and a limited budget.
