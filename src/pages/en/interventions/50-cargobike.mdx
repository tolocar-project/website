As part of the interventions in Chernihiv, a collaboration between the social bicycle workshop [Eco Misto](https://www.facebook.com/eco.cn.ua/) and [XYZ Cargo](http://www.xyzcargo.com/about/) took place.

XYZ Cargo has developed modular bicycles for different needs that can be assembled by hand without welding using schemes anywhere in the world. The organization brought three electric cargo bikes to Chernihiv, where the Eco City NGO promotes cycling culture and sustainable mobility.

The cargo electro bikes were assembled during a three-day workshop. Two are now used for reconstruction and volunteer needs, and the third one is used as a mobile bike workshop. Such cooperation - when initiatives from Ukraine and the world come together to strengthen communities - is one of the main goals of TOLOCAR. We are happy to be a bridge between the makers and improve the quality of life of the communities on the ground.
