Together with the Peremoha Center and KNUCA Lab, various furniture designs have emerged with Ostriv, all crafted using a CNC milling machine.

Drawing from prior experience in crafting plywood furniture with precision, the TOLOCAR team is excited to assemble these creations into a comprehensive catalogue of solutions (www.betterblock.org). To just drop a few ideas: hooks, pet boards, bar stools, chairs, swinging armchairs, folding chairs, bars, and more.
