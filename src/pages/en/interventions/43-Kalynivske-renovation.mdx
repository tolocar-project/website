Together, our team contributed to the renovation of a home belonging to a solitary elderly woman, whose residence had been ravaged by a Russian artillery shell. This was a continuation of earlier work carried out by various volunteer groups. We then concentrated in particular on renovating the walls and ceilings of the house.

This was the 2nd time that TOLOCAR had worked in areas heavily affected by military occupation and it was a very insightful experience for the team to understand the needs of such communities. It became very clear how necessary access to 'low-tech' tools and materials is in such areas and how effective renovation work is for both the recipients of this aid and those who provide it. 

The team was deeply convinced of the impact of 'making' and that soft skills and empathy are as important as the ability to operate a hammer drill.
