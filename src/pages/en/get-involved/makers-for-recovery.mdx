Despite the war, Ukrainian makers continue to innovate and “make” - they are keen to con-tribute to recovery and social coherence. Makerspaces in smaller towns have the potential to act as crucial local hubs for innovation and local recovery. However, often they lack the means to unleash their full potential, like resources, specific skills, or reliable local partner networks. 

The Makers4Recovery program aims to empower makerspaces to realize their full potential to contribute to local recovery within their communities. The program supports makerspaces with the necessary resources, networking, and skill development. The program consists of two interlinked components:

1. **Development support:** During the course of one year, the participating makerspac-es receive funding of 40.000€ and complementing expertise to develop their mak-erspace and anchor it in their community by forming meaningful relationships with local institutions and businesses.
2. **Project for recovery:** Within the one-year period, the participating makerspaces carry out one project contributing to local recovery. The makerspaces can get creative to come up with a participative project idea which is directly connected to the program's theme of “making for local recovery” and carried out within their community. For in-stance, the project may include the creation or rebuilding of public community spaces, workshops for civil society to build emergency aid items or activities supporting and involving vulnerable groups like internally displaced persons and veterans. 

During the funded period the makerspace is supported by a community manager. They will get support in forming new partnerships (moderating workshops, identifying relevant stake-holders and areas of cooperation), fundraising, documentation, and reporting. 


## Application
In December 2024 we open the submission of proposals. The participation in the program will be first-come-first-serve: As soon as enough applications meeting the requirements have been received, we will close the application. 

**Application is currently (Closed/open)**

## Who can participate?

### Eligibility criteria

1. Legal status: The makerspace should be operated by a registered NGO which complies with all relevant laws and regulations in the operating environment, includ-ing obtaining necessary permits and approvals.
2. Makerspace: The makerspace is already established and operating, meaning that there is a dedicated space with making equipment and some activities already took place there. The makerspace is located within a town or village with up to 150.000 inhabitants. The space has been operating for at least one year.
3. Monitoring and communications: The makerspace team has the ability and willing-ness to monitor and report on their activities and impact transparently and effec-tively.

### Selection criteria (based on your application)

4. The team of the makerspace is highly motivated to develop the makerspace sus-tainably.
5. The makerspace is eager to contribute to local recovery within the makerspace's direct surrounding and aims to develop their partner network to support this. The suggested project for recovery aligns with that goal. 
6. The makerspace is open to contribute to Ukrainian's maker community and their values align with Tolocar's fundamental principles of open knowledge sharing.
 
Please note that we will also select the makerspaces according to a geographically balanced distribution of makerspaces to support makerspaces across the country.


## Interested in applying for the program? Let us give you some details!

### What will your makerspace receive?
If your makerspace is selected to participate in the Makers4Recovery program, you will re-ceive support to develop your makerspace during the course of one year. You will receive a total of 40.000€ (about 1.7 Mio UAH) to come up with and test sustainable business models for your makerspace, to form and nurture new partnerships and to anchor the space as a beacon of local recovery within your community. A skilled community manager will accompa-ny you on this journey and help you with this endeavor. Additionally, you or your team will be supported in developing your skills according to your specific needs. For instance, we organ-ize mentoring or training sessions, or facilitate the knowledge exchange between your and other makerspaces. 

### Which activities take place during the one-year program?

**Development of partnerships:** You will establish new partnerships with relevant local, na-tional or international partners. This includes participating in a kick-off workshop, halftime workshop and closing workshop as well as taking the necessary steps between the work-shops with support of the community manager to initiate and develop partnerships with local and international stakeholders. The outcome of this activity is the establishment and docu-mentation of at least 5 new partnerships, of which at least one is with an international stake-holder. 

**Capacity development and fundraising:** You will participate in selected training or mentor-ing to ensure the sustainable development of the makerspace. Additionally, with support of the community manager you engage in fundraising activities (e.g. applying to grant competitions). The outcome of this activity is the participation in at least one relevant capacity development measure and the application for at least 2 relevant funding opportunities. 

**Project for local recovery:** You will implement a maker project contributing to local recovery of your choice. The project showcases how making can contribute to local recovery and ad-dresses the needs of the local community (i.e. civil society, municipality, local organizations or institutions). The implementation includes drafting and validating the project outline, implement-ing the project with at least one local and one international partner and documenting the im-pact.

**Monitoring and communications:** You assume the project management, monitoring, com-munication and reporting responsibilities for the program duration with support from the com-munity manager if needed. 
In the beginning of the program, a monitoring table, a quarterly reporting structure and a sur-vey template for beneficiaries will be shared with you to apply responsibly. With support of GIZ and the community manager, outcomes and lessons learned of the program and the pro-ject for recovery are monitored and reported transparently. Especially, newly established partnerships are documented according to the provided template. You will hand in quarterly reports describing the progress of the projects and partnerships, as well as learnings accord-ing to the provided template.
You also carry out financial management, monitoring and reporting according to GIZ's guide-lines. 
To communicate the achievements, you will provide visual and textual material of your activi-ties, so we can share them to our broad network.  All of your external communication (e.g. social media) is in accordance with the provided communication guideline. 
For all of your activities you will receive extensive support by the community manager and the GIZ team.
