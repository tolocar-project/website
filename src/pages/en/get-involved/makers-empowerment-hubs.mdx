Despite the war, Ukrainian makers continue to innovate and "make" - they are keen to con-tribute to the development and further recovery of Ukraine. Makerspaces in Ukrainian towns and cities have the potential to act as hubs for innovation and local development. However, often they lack the means to unleash their full potential, like resources, specific skills, or relia-ble local partner networks.

The Makers Empowerment Hubs program aims to empower makerspaces to realize their full potential to contribute to local development within their communities. The program supports makerspaces with the necessary resources, networking, and skill development. The program consists of two interlinked components:

1. **Development support:** During the course of one year, the participating makerspaces receive funding of 40.000€ (about 1.7 Mio UAH according to the exchange rate on the day the contract is concluded) and complementing expertise to develop their makerspace and anchor it in their community by forming meaningful relationships with local institutions and businesses. Participating makerspaces will develop strategies to ensure they thrive beyond the program's duration.
2. **Project for development:** Within the one-year period, the participating makerspaces carry out one project con-tributing to local development. The makerspaces can get creative to come up with a participative project idea which is directly connected to the program's theme of "making for local development" and addresses specific needs within their community. 

During the funded period the makerspace is supported by a community manager and GIZ. They will get support in forming new partnerships (moderating workshops, identifying relevant stakeholders and areas of cooperation), fundraising, documentation, reporting, and financial management.


## Application
As soon as enough applications meeting the eligibility criteria and quality criteria have been received, we will close the application.

**Application is currently (Closed/open)**

Please download application form and send it to [info@tolocar.org](mailto:info@tolocar.org).

## Who can participate?

### Eligibility criteria

1. Legal status: The makerspace should be operated by a registered NGO which complies with all relevant laws and regulations in the operating environment, including obtaining necessary permits and approvals.
2. Makerspace: The makerspace is already established and operating, meaning that there is a dedicated space with making equipment and some activities already took place there. The space has been operating for at least one year. However, the makerspace is still in a developmental stage.
3. Monitoring and communications: The makerspace team has the ability and willingness to monitor and report on their activities and impact transparently and effectively.

### Selection criteria (based on your application)

4. The team of the makerspace is highly motivated to develop the makerspace sustainably.
5. The makerspace is eager to contribute to local development within the makerspace's direct surrounding and aims to develop their partner network to support this. The suggested project for development aligns with that goal. 
6. The makerspace is open to contribute to Ukrainian's maker community and their values align with Tolocar's fundamental principles of open knowledge sharing.
 
Please note that we will also select the makerspaces according to a geographically balanced distribution of makerspaces to support makerspaces across the country. Preference will be given to makerspaces located within smaller Ukrainian towns and villages. 


## Interested in applying for the program? Let us give you some details!

### What will your makerspace receive?
If your makerspace is selected to participate in the Makers Empowerment Hubs program, you will receive over the course of one year:

1. A total of 40.000€ (about 1.7 Mio UAH according to the exchange rate on the day the contract is concluded) to carry out activities with the goal to develop your makeerspace's vision and self-reliance, to form meaningful partnerships and to carry out a project addressing local development needs within your community.
2. Support and advice to develop your makerspace Including support to come up with and test sustainable business models for your makerspace, to form and nurture new partnerships and to anchor the space as a beacon of local development within your community. A skilled community manager will accompany you on this journey and help you with this endeavor.
3. Support in developing your (or your team's) skills according to your specific needs. For instance, we organize mentoring or training sessions or facilitate the knowledge exchange between your and other makerspaces. 


### Which activities take place during the one-year program?

**Development of partnerships:** You will work on your path to self-reliance to ensure that your makerspace remains an active contributor to your community after the program. You will establish new partnerships with relevant local, national or international partners. This includes participating in a kick-off workshop, halftime workshop and closing workshop as well as taking the necessary steps between the workshops with support of the community manager to initiate and develop partnerships with local and international stakeholders. The outcome of this activity is the establish-ment and documentation of 5 new local and international partnerships. 

**Capacity development and fundraising:** You will participate in selected training or mentoring to ensure the sustainable development of the makerspace. Additionally, with support of the community manager you engage in fundraising activities (e.g. applying to grant competitions). The outcome of this activity is the participation in at least one relevant capacity development measure and the application for at least 2 relevant funding opportunities. 

**Project for local development:** You will implement a maker project contributing to local development of your choice. The project showcases how making can contribute to local development and addresses the needs of the local community (i.e. civil society, municipality, local organizations or institutions). The project may contribute to one or more of the one of the following fields: social cohesion, building and repairing, innovation, culture, community building, reskilling, inclusion and support of vulnerable groups, or similar areas. The implementation includes drafting and validating the project outline, implementing the project with newly established partnerships and documenting the impact.

**Monitoring and communications:** You take responsibility for the project management, monitoring, communication, reporting and financial management responsibilities for the program duration with support from the community manager and GIZ. In the beginning of the program, a monitoring table, a quarterly reporting structure and a survey template for beneficiaries will be shared with you to apply responsibly. With support of GIZ and the community manager, outcomes and lessons learned of the program and the project for development are monitored and reported transparently. Especially, newly established partnerships are documented according to the provided template. You will hand in quarterly reports describing the progress of the projects and partnerships, as well as learnings according to the provided template. You also carry out financial management, monitoring and reporting according to GIZ's guidelines. To communicate the achievements, you will provide visual and textual material of your activities. External communication (e.g. social media) is to be approved by GIZ and organized in accordance with the provided communication guidelines.
For all of your activities you will receive extensive support by the com-munity manager and the GIZ team.
